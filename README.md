How to Play
Pong is a two-player game, where you control one paddle and the computer controls the other. The objective is simple: score points by making the ball pass your opponent's paddle.

Controls
Use the ArrowUp and ArrowDown keys to move your paddle up and down.
On mobile devices, you can use on-screen touch controls to move your paddle.
Use the Pause button to pause the game and Resume to continue playing.
Click the Reset button to start a new game.
Game Features
Realistic ball physics.
Responsive design for desktop and mobile play.
Score tracking for both players.
Pause and resume functionality.
A restart button for starting a new game.
Sound Effects
The game includes sound effects for user interactions, such as clicking the "Start" button and paddle-ball collisions. Additionally, a "woosh" sound plays when the ball goes off the boundary. These sound effects enhance the gaming experience and can be customized by replacing the sound files in the sounds folder.
